Word segmentation algorithm: Max-length-match.

POS tagging algorithm: HMM with Viterbi algorithm.

## Use IntelliJ instead of Eclipse
I used IntelliJ to write this project, so [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is highly recommended rather than Eclipse, for if you use IntelliJ, everything's all set, while for eclipse you have to do something manually.

## How to run
Before you run it, check the class Constants. You should manually create the directories specified in Constants. Then it'll be all set. There are three classes each of which contains a main function. Those in SegmentationTask and PosTaggingTask runs only one task, respectively. The main function in ChineseNaturalLanguageProcess runs two tasks all at once.

## How to change experimental parameters
All changeable constants about this experiment are specified in Constants. Feel free to modify Constants and the three main functions to your own need for they are easy to understand and modify.

Also, if you have some fundamental knowledge about Java and NLP, this repo should be very easy for you to understand. Key parts are well-commented.
